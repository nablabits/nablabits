## Hey, it's 𝛁bits 👋

Massive data nerd with an interesting mix of intensity, code and, sometimes, machine learning.

- 👪 Happy member of the [ZeroDeposit family](https://github.com/ZeroDeposit) relocating nasty chores done by humans onto machines.
- 🛠️ Currently building a LLM-based semantic search engine in my spare time.
- 🐌 Trying to be consistent in open source collaborations.
- 💕 If you love life, life will love you back.

Something I:
- 🕵️ **Researched:** in the [agile optimization](https://github.com/nablabits/agile-optimization) repository I explored whether it's possible to get the right number of stories for a given sprint if only you know how well you are performing.
- 📖 **Recently learned:** in the [grid estimation](https://github.com/nablabits/cuda-grid-estimation) repository I learned the basics of CUDA programming with an easy algorithm based on the [Think Bayes](https://github.com/nablabits/ThinkBayes2/blob/master/notebooks/13-inference.ipynb) book.
- ✨ **Am really proud of:** in the [fareharbor webhook](https://github.com/nablabits/fareharbor-webhook) repository I built a webhook to process all the events of a booking engine which was the key part of a business intelligence dashboard I designed for a project I worked with.
- ⭐ **Am a huge fan of:** productivity and [self quantification.](https://quantifiedself.com/)
